== Smart.js firmware

=== Configuration infrastructure

After boot, Smart.js creates a WiFi Access Point (AP) called `SMARTJS_??????`,
where `??` are replaced by the hex numbers from device's MAC address.
On that AP, Smart.js runs a web server on address `192.168.4.1` with
a configuration interface:

- Join `SMARTJS_??????` AP and point your browser at link:http://192.168.4.1[]
- Change configuration parameters as needed, press Save.
- The module will reboot with new configuration.

It is possible to add custom parameters to the configuration UI - see section
below. Configuration parameters are accessible by JavaScript code through
`Sys.conf` variable.

=== Filesystem

Smart.js uses SPIFFS filesystem on some of the boards (e.g. ESP8266, CC3200).
SPIFFS is a flat filesystem, i.e. it has no directories. To provide the same
look at feel on all platforms, Smart.js uses flat filesystem on all
architectures.

Below there is a quick description of the files and their meaning.
System files, not supposed to be edited:

sys_init.js::
  Main system initialization file. This file is the only file
  called by the C firmware code.
conf_sys_defaults.json::
  System configuration.
conf_sys_schema.json::
  Contains description of the system configuration, used by the Web UI
  to render controls.
conf.json::
  This file can be absent. It is created by the Web UI when user saves
  configuration, and contains only overrides to system and app config files.
  NOTE: this file is preserved during OTA (Over-The-Air firmware update).
index.html::
  Configuration Web UI file.
sys_*.js::
  Various drivers.
imp_*::
  Files with `imp_` prefix are preserved during OTA update. Thus, if you'd
  like some data to survive firmware update, place that data into a file
  with prefix `imp_`.

Files that are meant to be edited by developers:

app.js::
  Application-specific file. This file is called by `sys_init.js`.
  User code must go here.
conf_app_defaults.json::
  Application-specific configuration file. Initially empty.
  If application wants to show it's
  own config parameters on the configuration Web UI, those parameters should
  go in this file.
conf_app_schema.json::
  Description of the app-specific config options.

=== Firmware startup process

When Smart.js starts, it reads `conf_sys_defaults.json`, merges it with,
`conf_app_defaults.json`, and subsequently merges with `conf.json`.
Therefore, in order to override any setting from the default config files,
put the override into `conf.json` - that's exactly what Web UI is doing when
user presses Save button.

`conf_app_defaults.json` file is empty by default. Put your application
specific configuration parameters there, the same way system parameters are
kept in `conf_sys_defaults.json`.

When firmware starts, it automatically connects to the cloud, which provides
services like OTA updates, device registry, time-series database,
PubSub (publish-subscribe), etc. That could be switched off in a respective
setting in the configuration file (`clubby.connect_on_boot`),
programmatically or using the Web UI.

=== Using configuration

Configuration is accesible from JS throught `Sys.conf` object. `Sys.conf` contains all values from
`conf_sys_defaults.json` and `conf.json` files in the form of sub-objects and properties.
For example, `Sys.conf.wifi.sta.enable` value turns on/off connection to Wifi. Value can be changed with
usual JS expression: `Sys.conf.wifi.sta.enable=true`.
Assignment of new values to `Sys.conf` properties is not permament, on reboot device will re-read values from
configuation file. Function `Sys.conf.save(reboot)` saves changed configuration to `conf.json` file.
If `reboot` parameter is set to `true` (default value) device will be rebooted after save in orders to
reinitialize all Smart.js modules.

==== Configuration parameters

`wifi.sta.enable`:: Enable or disable station. Enabling station disables AP unless `wifi.ap.keep_enabled` is set
`wifi.sta.ssid`:: SSID of WiFi network to connect
`wifi.sta.pass`:: Password of WiFi network to connect

`wifi.ap.enable`:: Enable or disable AP
`wifi.ap.keep_enabled`:: Keep AP enabled when station is on (if supported by the platform, e.g. ESP8266). Normally AP is turned off once station is configured
`wifi.ap.trigger_on_gpio`:: GPIO number, which should be grounded to force AP mode
`wifi.ap.ssid`:: SSID of created network
`wifi.ap.pass`:: Password for created network
`wifi.ap.hidden`:: Do not broadcast SSID
`wifi.ap.hidden`:: Network channel
`wifi.ap.ip`:: IP of the device in created network
`wifi.ap.netmask`:: Netmask of created network
`wifi.ap.gw`:: IP of gateway to use
`wifi.ap.dhcp_start`:: Clients IP range start
`wifi.ap.dhcp_end`:: Clients IP range end

`http.enable`:: Enable or disable configuration web-server
`http.listen_addr`:: Listen address for configuration web-server
`http.enable_webdav`:: Enable access to the device via WebDAV

`update.server_timeout`:: Timeout to use in network operations during update operation (seconds). Might be increased
for slow networks.

`clubby.connect_on_boot`:: Enable or disable default clubby connection on boot
`clubby.server_address`:: Default clubby server address (including port)
`clubby.device_id`:: The device ID used to connect clubby server
`clubby.device_psk`:: The device PSK used to connect clubby server
`clubby.device_auto_registration`:: Allow automatical obtaining of ID and PSK from Cesanta server
`clubby.device_registration_url`:: Server to obtain ID and PSK
`clubby.reconnect_timeout_min`, `clubby.reconnect_timeout_max`:: Timeouts to use in clubby network operations (seconds). Timeout grows with every
unsuccessful connection attempt, starting from `reconnect_timeout_min`, maximum value is `clubby.reconnect_timeout_max`
`clubby.cmd_timeout`:: Default life time for commands sent to server (seconds)
`clubby.memory_limit`:: Clubby can enqueue commands if connection is broken and send them once connection is restored. This feature will be disabled
if free memory amount is less than `memory_limit` value (bytes)

`debug.level`:: Level of logs detail. `0` - logs are disabled, `1` - errors only, `2` - errors and warnings, `3` - debug mode, `4` - enhanced debug mode
`debug.stdout_uart`:: Where to send normal (stdout) output. `0` - UART0, `1` - UART`, `-1` - /dev/null. Default: `0`.
`debug.stderr_uart`:: Where to send diagnostic (stderr) output. `0` - UART0, `1` - UART`, `-1` - /dev/null. Default: `1`.
`debug.enable_prompt`:: Whether to enable interactive JavaScript prompt. Default: `true`.
`debug.factory_reset_gpio`:: GPIO number that will trigger a factory reset if held low during boot. Default: `-1`.
