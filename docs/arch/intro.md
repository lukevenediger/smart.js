Smart.js firmware on a device side:

- Allows scripting for fast and safe development & firmware update. We do that
  by developing [V7 - the world's smallest JavaScript
  engine](https://github.com/cesanta/v7).
- Provides hardware and networking API that guarantees reliability, scalability
  and security out-of-the-box.
- Devices with our software can be managed remotely and update software
  remotely, in a fully automatic or semi-automatic way.
